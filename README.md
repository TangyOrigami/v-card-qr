# I don't know what I'm doing...yet

Activate venv:
    $: source bin/activate

To run:
    $: python3 main.py

Terminal will prompt user for directory where .vcf files are located. Then it will create the QR code and store them in the 'qr-codes' directory.

Still WIP.

Needs a lot of work.

Try at you own discression.
